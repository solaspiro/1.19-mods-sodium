90% of these mods are fabric only so make sure you have that installed and fabric api.


Optional mods you can remove them if you what to.


XaerosWorldMap / Xaeros_Minimap (note turn off player icons and mob icons and cave overlay)

replanter

notenoughanimations

whats that slot

CleanView

Durability101 

light overlay recommended to keep this

visuality adds cool effects (like shiny armour) but can be a bit buggy/

sodium can be replaced with optifine but this is not recommended unless you have a shader that doesn't work with sodium 

(No zooming on sodium or optifine please, just leave it unbound use a spyglass instead)

if you have any trouble with these mods please let us no and we will help as soon as possible
