# 1.19-mods-sodium

We strongly recommend you use multimc launch launcher of the default one.

How to download click on the click on green button and then download as zip put the .jars in your mod folder done 
if you don't have a mod folder make one.
alternatively you could do it through a terminal Linux FTW

You will also have to install fabric if you haven't done that already.
https://fabricmc.net/ you don't need to worry about it's api as it's already in this mod pack and will be updated when necessary 
90% of these mods are fabric only.

Optional mods you can remove them if you what to.

XaerosWorldMap / Xaeros_Minimap (note turn off player icons and mob icons and cave overlay)

replanter

notenoughanimations

whats that slot

CleanView

Durability101 

light overlay recommended to keep this

visuality adds cool effects (like shiny armour) but can be a bit buggy

sodium can be replaced with optifine but this is not recommended unless you have a shader that doesn't work with sodium 

(No zooming on sodium or optifine please, just leave it unbound use a spyglass instead)

if you have any trouble with these mods please let us no and we will help as soon as possible
