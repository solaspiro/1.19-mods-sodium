# 1.19-mods-sodium
NOTE  this is only so people can download the "allowed mods" easier for are private invite only server of course full/all credits to the mod creators plz don't dmca us XD (seriously though if you want your mod remove let us know)

If you have any trouble with these mods etc please let us no and we will help as soon as possible.
We strongly recommend you use PolyMC launcher https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC instead of the default one.

How to download click on the click on green button and then download zip put the .jars in your mod folder done 
if you don't have a mod folder make one.
alternatively you could do it through a terminal Linux FTW

You will also have to install fabric if you haven't done that already. this is easier through PolyMC
https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/ you don't need to worry about the api as it's already in this mod pack and will be updated when necessary 

90% of these mods are fabric only....

Optional mods you can remove them if you what to.

XaerosWorldMap / Xaeros_Minimap (note turn off player icons and mob icons and cave overlay)

replanter

lambdynamiclight

notenoughanimations

whats that slot

CleanView

Durability101 

light overlay recommended to keep this

visuality adds cool effects (like shiny armour) but can be a bit buggy

sodium can be replaced with optifine but this is not recommended unless you have a shader that doesn't work with sodium 

(No zooming on sodium or optifine please, just leave it unbound use a spyglass instead)
